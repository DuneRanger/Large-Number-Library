# Near Future

- Measure benchmark results, so that I can replace bigInt with bigIntTest
- Rename toString, so that it is recognisably exclusive to int128 (at at least all classes in my header file)

# Long term goals

- Unlimited size integer
- (unlimited size/precision) floats
- Allow string conversion to print any base
