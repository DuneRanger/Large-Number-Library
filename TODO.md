# Near Future

- Rename toString, so that it is recognisably exclusive to int128 (at at least all classes in my header file)

## Documentation

- Re-format the current benchmark results into a nice markdown table

# Long term goals

- Unlimited size integer
- (unlimited size/precision) floats
- Benchmark for different sets of numbers (i.e. Only less than 32 bit, only larger than 96 bit - just the extremes on both sides)
- Implement input from stream
